(breaking it was the only limit ofc) then I've started Jellyfin for a while when i was at home and outside and joined a University club on FOSS (Freedom and Open Source Software) and Linux , Honestly it was Mixed feelings .Then I've introduced Jellyfin to my friends , some liked it , some felt it was a waste of selfhosting stuff and we chose Netflix (ik I've broken streak of being Jacksparrow) and due to Grub issues and Display driver issue i stopped dual booting windows. Then i started using WSL on windows it wasn't that great in beginning but found my way through it. Then i came across Networking 101 and Communications 101 , then i came to know about physical devices and medium of transfers . Honestly it wasn't UpToDate and felt like it wasn't my turf for a bit just to spiral into it again. Then I've dug deep to learn about NAT , how does carriers use double NAT to protect and keep IPV4 from running out and how they fail to implement IPV6 and also understood what can happen with IPV6 if its also used as local Ip.</p><h2 id="andnbspwelcome-to-the-mainframe-falling-into-the-homelab-rabbit-hole-matrix-referenceandnbsp">&nbsp;"Welcome to the Mainframe" – Falling Into the Homelab Rabbit Hole (Matrix reference)&nbsp;</h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll.jpeg" height="675" width="1200" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-xs.jpeg 640w, https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-sm.jpeg 768w, https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-md.jpeg 1024w, https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-lg.jpeg 1366w, https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-xl.jpeg 1600w, https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-2xl.jpeg 1920w"></figure><p>At 18 I've fallen into the rabbit hole of homelabbing and local servers and hosting stuff and what i can host with my own servers and how much beneficial to me if i can host stuff on my own... Then i found that i had Digital ocean Credits with my GitHub Student Pack , so well then i got to know that i can pop a VM and use the public ip , so I've started to host Minecraft Servers on those VM's and used port and ip to connect in game to play with friends. with this i had practically used SSH and bash and pushed world data to GitHub&nbsp; using git as droplets were costly and we don't play daily. And then I've seen i can mask Ip with a human rememberable name with help of a domain from a DNS provider and I've seen that Namecheap was giving free domain with GitHub Student Developer pack and started to use DNS from then and like all good things come to end , we hit with a long pause in Minecraft ...</p><p>At 19 I've acquired a OEM Office Pc , keeping in mind with the power usage as i want it to be running 24/7 , I've chosen a More thread Cpu than the latest one Why ?

Cuz LXCs are lighter, faster, and easier than VMs and it uses same kernel as Host. I've installed Tailscale cuz My isp is behind a CGNAT and also it doesn't even allot a public ipv4 for router&nbsp;in this case i can’t simply open ports. Tailscale is just simplifying the setup process. Also tailscale is basically a reverse VPN tunnel. It can traverse NAT and especially is helpful. It is Much Safer and i can also use Exit nodes to route my traffic to home network and i can connect my devices in tailscale with a 10.0.0.x address inside regardless of what network i use mobile data or WIFI and tailscale Ip addresses aren't exposed to internet.</p><h2 id="zfs-or-nothing-truenasandnbsp">"ZFS or Nothing" – TrueNAS&nbsp;</h2><p>Then i have installed Truenas as a Virtualized NAS for centralized data storage, allowing easy access and sharing of files across a network and also it got great support for ZFS , snapshotting and Flexible RAID configurations</p><p>All the Vms are bridged in proxmox.</p><h2 id="homelab-2077">"Homelab 2077"</h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/rack-focus-blinking-server-lights-footage-069066931_iconl.webp" height="268" width="480" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/rack-focus-blinking-server-lights-footage-069066931_iconl-xs.webp 640w, https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/rack-focus-blinking-server-lights-footage-069066931_iconl-sm.webp 768w, https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/rack-focus-blinking-server-lights-footage-069066931_iconl-md.webp 1024w, https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/rack-focus-blinking-server-lights-footage-069066931_iconl-lg.webp 1366w, https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/rack-focus-blinking-server-lights-footage-069066931_iconl-xl.webp 1600w, https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/rack-focus-blinking-server-lights-footage-069066931_iconl-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p>There it started tinkering and tweaking .
