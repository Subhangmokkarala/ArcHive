a while when i was at home and outside and joined a University club on FOSS (Freedom and Open Source Software) and Linux , Honestly it was Mixed feelings .Then I've introduced Jellyfin to my friends , some liked it , some felt it was a waste of selfhosting stuff and we chose Netflix (ik I've broken streak of being Jacksparrow) and due to Grub issues and Display driver issue i stopped dual booting windows. Then i started using WSL on windows it wasn't that great in beginning but found my way through it. Then i came across Networking 101 and Communications 101 , then i came to know about physical devices and medium of transfers . Honestly it wasn't UpToDate and felt like it wasn't my turf for a bit just to spiral into it again. Then I've dug deep to learn about NAT , how does carriers use double NAT to protect and keep IPV4 from running out and how they fail to implement IPV6 and also understood what can happen with IPV6 if its also used as local Ip.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"andnbspwelcome-to-the-mainframe-falling-into-the-homelab-rabbit-hole-matrix-referenceandnbsp\">\n      &nbsp;\"Welcome to the Mainframe\" – Falling Into the Homelab Rabbit Hole (Matrix reference)&nbsp;\n    </h2>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll.jpeg\" height=\"675\" width=\"1200\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-xs.jpeg 640w ,https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-sm.jpeg 768w ,https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-md.jpeg 1024w ,https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-lg.jpeg 1366w ,https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-xl.jpeg 1600w ,https://archive.subhangmokkarala.me/media/posts/1/responsive/giBJ0ezYNEobFBfB8H4JNTjmll-2xl.jpeg 1920w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    At 18 I've fallen into the rabbit hole of homelabbing and local servers and hosting stuff and what i can host with my own servers and how much beneficial to me if i can host stuff on my own...
